A pen Latin penna feather is a writing implement used to apply ink to a surface such as paper for writing or drawing Historically reed pens quill pens and dip pens were used with a nib dipped in ink Ruling pens allow precise adjustment of line width and still find a few specialized uses but technical pens such as the Rapidograph are more commonly used Modern types also include ballpoint rollerball fountain and felt or ceramic tip pens

Types of pensedit
Modernedit
The main modern types of pens can be categorized by the kind of writing tip or point on the pen




An inexpensive ballpoint pen



A ballpoint pen dispenses ink by rolling a small hard sphere usually mm and made of brass steel or tungsten carbide The ink dries almost immediately on contact with paper The ballpoint pen is usually reliable and comes in both inexpensive and expensive types It has replaced the fountain pen as the most common tool for everyday writing
A rollerball pen dispenses a water-based liquid or gel ink through a ball tip similar to that of a ballpoint pen The less-viscous ink is more easily absorbed by paper than oil-based ink and the pen moves more easily across a writing surface The rollerball pen was initially designed to combine the convenience of a ballpoint pen with the smooth wet ink effect of a fountain pen Gel inks are available in a range of colors including metallic paint colors glitter effects neon blurred effects saturated colors pastel tones vibrant shades shady colors invisible ink see-through effect shiny colors and glow-in-the-dark effects
A fountain pen uses water-based liquid ink delivered through a nib The ink flows from a reservoir through a feed to the nib then through the nib due to capillary action and gravity The nib has no moving parts and delivers ink through a thin slit to the writing surface A fountain pen reservoir can be refillable or disposable this disposable type being an ink cartridge A pen with a refillable reservoir may have a mechanism such as a piston to draw ink from a bottle through the nib or it may require refilling with an eyedropper Refill reservoirs also known as cartridge converters are available for some pens which use disposable cartridges
A marker or felt-tip pen has a porous tip of fibrous material The smallest finest-tipped markers are used for writing on paper Medium-tip markers are often used by children for coloring and drawing Larger markers are used for writing on other surfaces such as corrugated boxes whiteboards and for chalkboards often called liquid chalk or chalkboard markers Markers with wide tips and bright but transparent ink called highlighters are used to mark existing text Markers designed for children or for temporary writing as with a whiteboard or overhead projector typically use non-permanent inks Large markers used to label shipping cases or other packages are usually permanent markers

Historicedit
These historic types of pens are no longer in common use as writing instruments but may be used by calligraphers and other artists




A dip pen



A dip pen or nib pen consists of a metal nib with capillary channels like that of a fountain pen mounted on a handle or holder often made of wood A dip pen usually has no ink reservoir and must be repeatedly recharged with ink while drawing or writing The dip pen has certain advantages over a fountain pen It can use waterproof pigmented particle-and-binder-based inks such as so-called India ink drawing ink or acrylic inks which would destroy a fountain pen by clogging as well as the traditional iron gall ink which can cause corrosion in a fountain pen Dip pens are now mainly used in illustration calligraphy and comics A particularly fine-pointed type of dip pen known as a crowquill is a favorite instrument of artists such as David Stone Martin and Jay Lynch because its flexible metal point can create a variety of delicate lines textures and tones with slight pressures while drawing
The ink brush is the traditional writing implement in East Asian calligraphy The body of the brush can be made from either bamboo or rarer materials such as red sandalwood glass ivory silver and gold The head of the brush can be made from the hair or feathers of a wide variety of animals including the weasel rabbit deer chicken duck goat pig tiger etc There is also a tradition in both China and Japan of making a brush using the hair of a newborn as a once-in-a-lifetime souvenir for the child This practice is associated with the legend of an ancient Chinese scholar who scored first in the Imperial examinations by using such a personalized brush Calligraphy brushes are widely considered an extension of the calligrapher's arm Today calligraphy may also be done using a pen but pen calligraphy does not enjoy the same prestige as traditional brush calligraphy
A quill is a pen made from a flight feather of a large bird most often a goose Quills were used as instruments for writing with ink before the metal dip pen the fountain pen and eventually the ballpoint pen came into use Quill pens were used in medieval times to write on parchment or paper The quill eventually replaced the reed pen
A reed pen is cut from a reed or bamboo with a slit in a narrow tip Its mechanism is essentially similar to that of a quill The reed pen has almost disappeared but it is still used by young school students in some parts of India and Pakistan who learn to write with them on small timber boards known as Takhti

Historyedit




M Klein and Henry W Wynne received US patent in  for an ink chamber and delivery system in the handle of the fountain pen


Ancient Egyptians had developed writing on papyrus scrolls when scribes used thin reed brushes or reed pens from the Juncus maritimus or sea rush In his book A History of Writing Steven Roger Fischer suggests that on the basis of finds at Saqqara the reed pen might well have been used for writing on parchment as long ago as the First Dynasty or about  BC Reed pens continued to be used until the Middle Ages although they were slowly replaced by quills from about the th century The reed pen generally made from bamboo is still used in some parts of Pakistan by young students and is used to write on small boards made of timbercitation needed
The reed pen survived until papyrus was replaced by animal skins vellum and parchment as a writing surface The smoother surface of skin allowed finer smaller writing by the quill pen derived from the flight feather The quill pen was used in Qumran Judea to write some of the Dead Sea Scrolls which date back to around  BC The scrolls were written in Hebrew dialects with bird feathers or quills After the fall of the Roman Empire Europeans had difficulty in obtaining reedscitation needed and began to use quills There is a specific reference to quills in the writings of St Isidore of Seville in the th century Quill pens were still widely used in the th century and were used to write and sign the Constitution of the United States in 
A copper nib was found in the ruins of Pompeii showing that metal nibs were used in the year  There is also a reference to 'a silver pen to carry ink in' in Samuel Pepys' diary for August  'New invented' metal pens are advertised in The Times in  A metal pen point was patented in  but the patent was not commercially exploited A patent for the manufacture of metal pens was advertised for sale by Bryan Donkin in  John Mitchell of Birmingham started to mass-produce pens with metal nibs in  and thereafter the quality of steel nibs had improved enough that dip pens with metal nibs came into generalized use




Deliciae physico-mathematicae 


The earliest historical record of a pen employing a reservoir dates back to the th century In  Ma'd al-Mu'izz the Fatimid Caliph of Egypt demanded a pen which would not stain his hands or clothes and was provided with a pen which held ink in a reservoir and delivered it to the nib This pen may have been a fountain pen but its mechanism remains unknown and only one record mentioning it has been found A later reservoir pen was developed in  In his Deliciae Physico-Mathematicae  German inventor Daniel Schwenter described a pen made from two quills One quill served as a reservoir for ink inside the other quill The ink was sealed inside the quill with cork Ink was squeezed through a small hole to the writing point In  Bartholomew Folsch received a patent in England for a pen with an ink reservoir
While a student in Paris Romanian Petrache Poenaru invented the fountain pen which the French Government patented in May  Fountain pen patents and production then increased in the s
The first patent on a ballpoint pen was issued on October   to John J Loud In  Lszl Br a Hungarian newspaper editor with the help of his brother George a chemist began to work on designing new types of pens including one with a tiny ball in its tip that was free to turn in a socket As the pen moved along the paper the ball rotated picking up ink from the ink cartridge and leaving it on the paper Br filed a British patent on June   In  the Br brothers and a friend Juan Jorge Meyne moved to Argentina fleeing Nazi Germany and on June  filed another patent and formed Br Pens of Argentina By the summer of  the first commercial models were available Erasable ballpoint pens were introduced by Papermate in  when the Erasermate was put on the market




 advertisement for Vulcan Ink Pencils


Slavoljub Eduard Penkala a naturalized Croatian engineer and inventor of Polish-Dutch origin from the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia in Austria-Hungary became renowned for further development of the mechanical pencil   then called an automatic pencil  and the first solid-ink fountain pen  Collaborating with an entrepreneur by the name of Edmund Moster he started the Penkala-Moster Company and built a pen-and-pencil factory that was one of the biggest in the world at the time This company now called TOZ-Penkala still exists today TOZ stands for Tvornica olovaka Zagreb meaning Zagreb Pencil Factory




Modern marker pens


In the s the fiber or felt-tipped pen was invented by Yukio Horie of the Tokyo Stationery Company Japan Papermate's Flair was among the first felt-tip pens to hit the US market in the s and it has been the leader ever since Marker pens and highlighters both similar to felt pens have become popular in recent times
Rollerball pens were introduced in the early s They make use of a mobile ball and liquid ink to produce a smoother line Technological advances achieved during the late s and early s have improved the roller ball's overall performance A porous point pen contains a point that is made of some porous material such as felt or ceramic A high quality drafting pen will usually have a ceramic tip since this wears well and does not broaden when pressure is applied while writing
Although the invention of the typewriter and personal computer with the keyboard input method have changed how users write the pen has not been entirely replaced Higher end pens including fountain pens are still a status symbol
